### Django Signals

**Question 1:**  

By default, are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance._

**Answer:**  
By default, Django signals are executed **synchronously**. This means that when a signal is sent, the receiver function is executed immediately in the same flow as the sender, and it will block further code execution until it's completed.

Here’s a simple code snippet to demonstrate this:

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import time

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_signal_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received for user: {instance.username}")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a delay
    print("Signal processing finished.")

# Create a user to trigger the signal
user = User.objects.create(username="testuser")
```

In this example, when a new user is created, the `post_save` signal is triggered, and the `my_signal_receiver` function is executed immediately, with a 5-second delay to show that it's blocking the main flow of execution.

**Question 2:**  
_Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet._

**Answer:**  
Yes, by default Django signals run in the **same thread** as the calling code. You can prove this by checking the current thread in both the main execution flow and the signal receiver function.

```python
import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_signal_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Trigger the signal by creating a new user
print(f"Main thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
user = User.objects.create(username="testuser")
```

Both the main thread and the thread where the signal is processed should have the same name, proving that the signal runs in the same thread as the caller.

**Question 3:**  
_Do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet._

**Answer:**  
Yes, Django signals run in the **same database transaction** as the caller, meaning if the caller's transaction is rolled back, the signal’s transaction will also be rolled back.

Here’s an example:

```python
from django.db import transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_signal_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    in_transaction = transaction.get_connection().in_atomic_block
    print(f"Signal received within a transaction: {in_transaction}")

# Creating a user within a transaction block
with transaction.atomic():
    user = User.objects.create(username="testuser")
```

In this code, we check if the signal is part of the current database transaction. Since the `post_save` signal runs inside the `transaction.atomic()` block, the output will confirm it's in the same transaction.
